Purpose
--------------
Eat fit is a component for attractive data representation inspired by Google Fit. It is based on PageViewController, interface for customization is implemented in UITableViewDataSource style.

Supported OS & SDK Versions
-----------------------------

The component is implemented in Swift 2.0

* Supported build target - iOS 9.0 (Xcode 7)


ARC Compatibility
------------------

EatFit requires ARC. 

Thread Safety
--------------

EatFit is subclassed from UIView and - as with all UIKit components - it should only be accessed from the main thread. You may wish to use threads for loading or updating EatFit contents or items, but always ensure that once your content has loaded, you switch back to the main thread before updating the EatFit.

Installation
--------------

To install manually the EatFit component in an app, drag EatFit folder with all contents into your project. Use 
EatFitViewController as any other view controller in your app. Setup is done via data source pattern. EatFitViewController's data source must adopt protocol EatFitViewControllerDataSource


Memory issues
--------------
Inside the component pages are reused just like cells in UITableView. There are no more than 3 pages exist in memory at any moment no matter how many pages the component shows.

Properties
--------------

The EatFit has following properties:
```swift
	weak var dataSource: EatFitViewControllerDataSource!
```

Methods
--------------

The EatFitViewController class has the following methods:
```swift
	func reloadData()
```
This reloads all the component from the dataSource and refreshes the display.

Data source protocol
---------------
The EatFitViewControllerDataSource protocol has the following methods:
```swift
    func numberOfPagesForPagingViewController(controller: EatFitViewController) -> Int
```

```swift
    func chartColorForPage(index: Int, forPagingViewController controller: EatFitViewController) -> UIColor
```
